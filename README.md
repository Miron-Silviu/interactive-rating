Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  @media screen and (min-width: 1204px) and (max-width: 2600px) {
    .container {
      margin-top: 7rem;
    }
    .pop-up {
      margin-bottom: 7rem;
    }
    .container,
    .pop-up {
      background-color: var(--Dark-Blue);
      margin-left: 2rem;
      margin-right: 2rem;
      height: auto;
      width: 20%;
    }
  }
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰');
};
```
